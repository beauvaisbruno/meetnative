Android Manually
If you plan to do the changes manually then there are a lot of files to change. There may actually be more depending on what you have added to your project. This is a guide for changing a vanilla project.

In the application root

In the app.json change the name and the displayName to be "project"

In the package.json change the name to be "name": "project",

android/settings.gradle

Change the rootProject.name to the name that you want: rootProject.name = 'project'

android/app/build.gradle

In the default config change the applicationId to the application Id that you want, in this case: applicationId com.awesome.project

android/app/BUCK

Change the package in both the android_build_config and the android_resources to the desired package, in this case: package = "com.awesome.project",

android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

Change the package to the desired package name, in this case: package="com.awesome.project"

android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml

Change the app name to the desired app name, in this case <string name="app_name">project</string>

Updating the *.java files

This bit is tricker as you have to create folders, move files and then rename parts of the internals of the files.

android/app/src/main/java/com/

Create a folder called awesome and inside that folder create a folder called project

Copy the MainActivty.java and the MainApplication.java from the android/app/src/main/java/com/myawesomeproject into the recently created android/app/src/main/java/com/awesome/project folder.

Inside the both the  MainActivity.java and the MainApplication.java remane the package at the top of the files from package com.myawesomeproject; to package com.awesome.project;

Also in the MainActivity.java rename the string that is returned by the getComponentName() function to "project"
